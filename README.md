# Betfair-betting-profitability-calculation

Hello, I have written python project to demonstrate profitability of 2 kinds of bets:

- Bet on correct score 1:1 

- Bet on win of favorite team agains outsider

Over a certain amount of time I collected coefficient data and conducted statistics of a positive (named in json like "+") or negative (named in json like "-" outcome for us.

# Consider the example of the match Napoli-Milan

In this case, a coefficient of 7.2 is available for us, since the coefficients are higher (for example, 7.4) are in the auction:

In this case, a coefficient of 2.02 is available to us

# Created tables

As field "result" is obligatory, I must fill them not knowing result, because let's imagine that Napoli won 2:1 and fill tables
